# BIT-E-Library_Management
This is a E-library Application made using Switch case  where the user/Student is given a choice to add the book to the Library and can also read them.
I'm still working on this application and trying to add more features.

### Concepts Used

- Java.util package is imported.
- this() is used to invoke current class constructor.
- Scanner class is used for taking the details of the book from the user.
- while loop and switch case will help the user to enter choice.
- Concept of Try Catch is also used.
- String and int data type are mainly used in the code.
